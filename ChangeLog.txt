Dirt ChangeLog

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 28 (2013-04-09)
  * Added password protection (for shared computers). The password can be
    defined either as text or as a SHA-1 or MD5 hash. See "dirt.ini" and the
    "Configuring Dirt" chapter in the manual.
  * Added rudimentary SOCKS v5 firewall support for passworded connections.
    It will listen on port 10588 by default.
  * Added decryption of logged messages by psyBNC through /playprivatelog.
  * Fixed a serious bug with /sendkey <nick> <channel> (to send channel keys)
    that would send the key in plain text in some cases.
  * Fixed the bug on unix-like systems where dirt.ini and dirt.key would be
    duplicated to the working directory (very rare except with the --user and
    --group options).
  * Several minor bug fixes and alchemical refinements.

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 27 (2013-03-17)
  * Added channel topic encryption/decryption. Decryption is automatic.
    Use the "/dirt topic" command when you want to set an encrypted topic on a
    channel.
  * It is now compilable and fully working on x64 architectures.
  * Added --user=X and --group=X parameters to the unix version (for use in
    shell scripts running as root:root).
  * The configuration file (dirt.ini) will not ever be overwritten by Dirt
    anymore. But it is still generated if it doesn't already exist and upgraded
    by the Windows installer (using the old one as a reference).
  * All changes in dirt.ini will be recognized on "/dirt load".
  * The executable is now dirtirc[.exe]. The program is still titled "Dirt",
    this is to separate it from other programs with the same name.
  * Improved the help system quite a bit.
  * Added wildcard matching for /keys, /showkey and /showkeytext (you can list
    known channel keys with /keys #* for example).
  * A whole lot of bug fixes, optimizations and improvements here and there.

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 26 (2013-02-21)
  * Restored the classic systray icons on Windows (due to a general preference
    in qualitative and quantative studies, involving almost two test subjects,
    and to help out people with colour blindness or greyscale display devices).
  * Changed the message prefixes that are used by default (for better contrast
    against most backgrounds).

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 25 (2006-12-17)
  * Changed the way that the info messages are sent to the client to make it
    work with some (buggy) mIRC theme systems.
  * As always, a bunch of minor optimizations, clarifications and cosmetical
    touches have been made.

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 24 (2006-12-02)
  * Changed the location of the ini/key files on Windows, they are now
    located under "%APPDATA%\Dirt".
  * Old ini/key files will be imported automatically when starting Dirt,
    with a message telling the user of the new location.
  * Fixed a bug that would overwrite dirt.ini with defaults in some cases.

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 23 (2006-11-29)
  * Fixed a major bug with /sendkey (not security-related however).

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 22 (2006-11-29)
  * Added full support for nick and channel aliases. Check the /addalias
    and /removealias commands. All commands will accept either the original
    name or an alias when specifying a nick or channel name.
  * Very long outgoing text (currently that's anything longer than 256
    characters when unencrypted) will now be split into several messages
    when using FiSH encryption. This means that you can send messages of
    (almost) any length without risking that the IRC server cuts them off.
  * Improved the support for dircproxy time stamps when reading encrypted
    message logs (dates are supported now).

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 21 (2006-11-22)
  * Added auto-upgrade functionality for Windows (on right-click menu).

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 20 (2006-11-20)
  * Created a very nice installer for Windows, using NSIS.
  * Added --quit and -q parameters for Windows, which quits all running
    instances of Dirt (the installer and uninstaller uses this too).
    Note that it will not be able to quit earlier versions with this.
  * Fixed the CTCP DIRT reply.
  * It now uses ~/.dirtrc for all configuration files on unix systems.
  * Added "make install" for unix (you'll need to be root of course).

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 19 (2006-10-30)
  * We got brand new application and systray icons, thanks to Heinzon!
  * Under Windows, the systray icon now survives a Explorer.exe crash.

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 18 (2006-10-06)
  * Fixed several issues with the Windows systray right-click menu.
  * Added support for decrypting time stamped log text from dircproxy.
  * It now automatically saves the key file when a channel key is received.
    Yes, brane was right all along... sorry!
  * Added the help system.

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 17 (2006-10-02)
  * When auto-accept is enabled (which it is by default), it is limited to
    keys for nick names. Channel key has to be accepted manually now. This
    was done for obvious security reasons.

Dirt 1.0.0 alpha 16 (2006-10-02)
  * It is now statically linked again, so you do not need to have
    libeay32.dll. This was a mistake on my part, sorry!
