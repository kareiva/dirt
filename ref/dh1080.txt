Diffie-Hellman 1080bit Key-exchange
***********************************


For Diffie-Hellman key-exchange a 1080bit germain prime is used, the
generator g=2 renders a field Fp from 1 to p-1. Therefore breaking it
means to solve a discrete logarithm problem with no less than 1080bit.

Base64 format is used to send the public keys over IRC.

The calculated secret key is hashed with SHA-256, the result is converted
to base64 for final use with blowfish.
