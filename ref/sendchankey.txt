                     The Dirt IRC SENDCHANKEY protocol v1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dirt has implemented a VERY simple way of sending channel keys.


It first makes sure that the transmission is encrypted (there is a key set and
enabled for the recipient's nick name), and then does
  NOTICE <key-receiver> :SENDCHANKEY <#channel> <key>
Where <key> is not encoded in any special way.

The recipient then sends back
  NOTICE <key-sender> :ACCEPTCHANKEY <#channel>
This step is not considered obligatory though.

If you are writing a script or using commands in an IRC client somehow, it will
add the ":" in front of the text part of raw server messages by itself, thus:
  /notice <key-receiver> SENDCHANKEY <#channel> <key>

This is currently not supported by any other IRC clients or scripts, but has
the same safety as any other encrypted messages and will be understood even if
the other end is not using Dirt, providing that the communication is decrypted.
