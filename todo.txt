To-do-list for the Dirt IRC proxy

Note: When these are added to the SourceForge site (Bugs or Feature Requests)
they are removed from this list.

* Add an option to periodically check for upgrades on Windows systems.

* Add a simple status window for the Windows version, accessible from the
  notification area (systray). Also a --status parameter for Unix.

* Improve "dirtirc --quit" behavior on Windows to quit only a conflicting
  dirt.exe (for better multi-user support, or for people running several
  instances on different ports) and to work with older versions.

* Encapsulate the Unix and Windows code into a try-catch block (for more
  informational error messages).

* Use a different implementation of the SHA256 function (it should compile
  with OpenSSL 0.9.7), like FiSHy does.
